The similarities between nextjs and MERN stack:

1. JavaScript-based
   Both use JavaScript extensively:
   - Next.js is a React framework, so it utilizes JavaScript (or typescript) for building frontend components and server-side logic
   - The MERN stack revolves around JavaScript as well

2. React for Frontend Development
   - Next.js is built on top of React with added like server-side rendering and API routes
   - The MERN stack uses React for building UI

3. Backend and API Handling 
   - In Next.js, backend APIs can be built using API routes similar to Express routes in the MERN stack
   - MERN utilizes Express with Node.js for handling server-side logic and APIs

 4. Both can be used for full-stack development:
   - Next.js uses backend logic and frontend in the same project
   - The MERN stack separates frontend (React) and backend (Express/Node.js) but can be a unified system

What I learnt:
I started this project for fun in October and used it to solidify my understand of creating a nextjs application and I also learnt is how to implement cloud based database (vercel postgresql).
